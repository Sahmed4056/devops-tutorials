u. uptime
   hostname
   cat /etc/redht-realese

   ifconfig

v. cut - cut command used to extract parts of the each line from a file.
	 It will extract the parts of the line based
		- byte/character based
		- field based on delimeter (By default the delimeter is tab)

   i. Get first character from a file
	cut -c 1 /etc/passwd
	cut -b 1 /etc/passwd

   ii. Get the characeters from all the lines from 1-10 characters of a file
	cut -c 1-10 /etc/passwd
	cut -c -10 /etc/passwd

   iii. Get the characters some particular range
	cut -c 2-3, 10-12 /etc/passwd
	cut -c 1- /etc/passwd


	one	two	three
	four	five	six
	seven	eight	nine

    iv. Fetch fields of particular files using field seperator
	cut -f 1,3 samp.out
	cut -f 1 samp.out

     v. If delemeter is other than tab
	
	one;two;three
	four;five;six
	seven;eight;nine

	cut -d ';' -f 1 samp.out

	cut -d ':' -f 1,4 /etc/passwd

    vi. Replace the delemeter in output with different delimeter
	cut -d ':' -f 1,4 /etc/passwd --output-delimeter=' '

    vii. Fetch httpd version alone using cut command
	httpd -v | grep -i version | cut -d '/' -f 2 | cut -d ' ' -f 1

w. awk - It's a shell script used to process the command text
	fristName       lastName        age     city       ID

	Thomas          Shelby          30      Rio        400

	Timmy           Turner          32      Berlin     N/A	

	cat samp.txt | awk '{print $1, $4}'

x. free -h
   df -h
   du -sh
   
y. find - useful to check where exactly particular file/folder presents on the machine.
	find / -name aws
	
z. top

aa. create a user with default home directory
	useradd anusha
	passwd anusha
     
    create a user with custom home directory
    	useradd -d /data/anusha chaitanya

    change passwd
	passwd chaitanya

    The created userid details are stored in a file called /etc/passwd

    Whenever we create a user by default one group also will gets created if group not exists.

    To create user & add it under particular group
	useradd -g tecmint tarunika

    To add users in particular groups
	groupadd admins
	groupadd webadmin
	groupadd developers
	usermod -a -G admins,webadmin,developers tecmint
	useradd -G admins,webadmin,developers paddy	

ab. Normally we do three types of operations on files/folder
	r 	w 	x
     
    The chmod permissions
	r - 4
	w - 2
	x - 1
	 600
	 rw------
	rw-rw-r-x
	u  g  p
	
     create a file /tmp directory
	echo "Checking the permissions of users/groups/public" > /tmp/abc.out
	chmod 400 /tmp/abc.out
	
	Now only the owner have read privileges & try to access the /tmp/abc.out with different user           privilges error will get.

ac. Install pkgs
	yum list all
	yum list all installed
	yum install -y git
	yum remove git -y
	yum updte -y

	unix is great os. unix is opensource. unix is free os.
	learn operating system.
	unix linux which one you choose.
	unix is easy to learn.unix is a multiuser os.Learn unix .unix is a powerful.
        
	i. Replace first occurance of unix in a file

	   s --> substitution.

	ii. Replace second occurances of unix in a file
		sed 's/unix/linux/2' temp.txt

	iii. Replace alloccurances of unix in a file
		sed 's/unix/linux/g' temp.txt
	
17. softlink & hard link

	inode:- address of the file where exactly its stored on harddisk

	hardlink - The original & hardlink file will have same inode
			   If we delete any file we can access other file also
			   ln samp hardlink

	softlink - The original & softlink file will have different inode
			   If we delete original file the softlink can't be accessed.
				ln -s samp softlink
				rm softlink	
	

18. zip
	zip -r backup.zip backup
	tar -cvf backup.tar /home/devloper1/backup/
	tar -czvf backup.tar.gz /home/developer1/backup/

	c - create archive file
	v - verbose
	f - file
	Z- compress

	unzip
	unzip backup.zip
	tar -xzvf backup.tar.gz
