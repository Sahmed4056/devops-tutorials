Shell script used to automate repetative tasks in Unix.
What is shell script?
It's a text used to write system level commands in sequence inorder to achieve our requirement.


usecase:
-----------
Find the 
	- Version of httpd
	- status of httpd service
	- Port listening {cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf | grep -i ^Listen}


#!/bin/bash
httpd --version
systemctl status httpd
cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf | grep -i ^Listen


The above shell script is a simple shell script, we can enhance this script using,
- Variables
- Filters like grep, awk, tail..etc commands
- loops
- Conditional statements & many more


#!/bin/bash
httpd_v=`httpd --version | awk ${print $3}`
httpd_status=`systemctl status httpd | grep Active | awk ${print $2}`
httpd_port=`cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf | grep -i ^Listen | awk ${print $2}`
echo "The version of httpd is: $httpd_v"
echo "The status of httpd is: $httpd_status"
echo "The port of httpd is: ${httpd_port}"


chmod +x httpd_details.sh
./httpd_details.sh

1. Whenever we execute any command/script on the terminal it will reach to operating system & the    opearating system reacts to the command with the program called shell.

2. In our unix world we have different types of shells. To see these different shells
   cat /etc/shells

	/bin/sh
	/bin/bash
	/bin/zsh
	/bin/ksh

3. a. In this bash is the advanced & latest shell.
   b. Now a days almost by default all the flavours of unix operating systems works with bash shell          programming.
   c. Because of this reason bash scripting we call.
   d. There is no other major difference in writing scripting in other shells, just bash is the latest       & advanced shell.
