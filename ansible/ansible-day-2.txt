
Ansible components
==================
Before jump into ansible further we have to get familar with few of terminologies

/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg ==> Is the default configuration file of ansible, which is useful to manage
                             ansible playbooks or ansible commands.
                             I will discuss more details with example in sometime.
                             
/etc/ansible/hosts ==> Is the default inventory file, contains list of target machine IP addresses/hostnames.

tasks ==> Activites that we are going to managed on target servers.
          - Installing git activity on target server will be considered as one activity.
            yum install git -y
          - Starting the httpd service activity on target server will be considered as one activity.
            systemctl start httpd
            
playbooks ==> Playbooks are collection of tasks

modules ==> Modules are predefind commands/units which are used inside the playbooks or commands inorder 
            to execute on target machines.
            
Ansible Ad-hoc commands
=========================
When you have a need of run repeated task on setup of servers then we can use ansible adhoc commands.

a. Let's assuming on quatery patching cycle you have rebooted large number of servers & you want to find which are the servers up & running.
   ansible -m ping all

    syntax:
    ansible -m <module_name> -a "argument" <group_name/all>


b. Command module:-  Used excute any shell command target machine, then we use shell command

    Find out uptime of the list of servers.
    ansible -m command -a "uptime" all
    
    Find out the home directory of ansible user in target machines
    ansible -m command -a "pwd" all
    
c. stat: Displays the staticis of the file
    ansible -m stat -a "/etc/hostname" all
    
e. group: used to create/delete groups on target machines  {Cache issue}
   Create a unix user group with ansible ad hoc command
   i. Create a user name group named dbadmin using the ansible group module.
      ansible -i ~/hosts -m group -a "name=dbadmin state=present" all
      
   ii. Delete a user name group named dbadmin using the ansible group module.
      ansible -i ~/hosts -m group -a "name=dbadmin state=absent" all

f. COPY: Used to copy the files to target machine from controller machine
    ansible -i ~/hosts -m copy -a "src=/etc/hosts dest=/tmp/hosts mode=600"
    
g. file:
    i. create a new directory with 755 permisssion
       ansible -m file -a "path=/opt/oracle state=directory mode=0755" all
    ii. create a new file with 755 permisssion
       ansible -m file -a "path=/opt/oracle state=file mode=0755" all
    
h. yum:
    Install a package or software in linux using yum module of ansible
    ansible -m yum -a "name=httpd state=installed" all
    
    Remove sudo access on target & repeate yum module, if we don't have sudo access on remote installation
    will be failed.
    
i. service:
    start/stop httpd service on target machine
    # To Start
    ansible -m service -a "name=httod state=started enabled=yes" all
    
    # To Stop
    ansible -m service -a "name=httpd state=stop enabled=yes" all
    
j. get_url:
    Download a file from URL in ansible
    ansible -m get_url -a "url=https://nodejs.org/dist/v14.17.4/node-v14.17.4-linux-x64.tar.xz dest=/tmp mode=0755" all

k. setup:
    Displays facts about the target machines
    ansible -m setup all


=============================================    
Inventory file
==============================================
The inventory file have a set of nodes which we are going to target.

a. The default inventory file is /etc/ansible/hosts

b. We can't change every time the default inventory file we can change it using -i option
   -i hosts

    Use inventory file other than default inventory file
    ansible -i ~/hosts -m command -a "uptime" all

c. We can change the inventory file location to different file permanently by modifing ansible.cfg
    inventory=/root/hosts
    library ==> Contains modules that are present ansible
    remote_tmp ==> When we execute ansible commands it requires some temporary space required  on remote side.
    local_tmp ==> When we execute ansible commands it requires some temporary space required  on local side.
    forks ==> The number of parallel executions on target machine
               suppose if you have 100 machines & fork count is 5 only first 5 servers completed & next go for another 5 like that till 100
    poll_intervel ==> 
    
    module = command
        ansible all -a "uptime"
        ansible all -a "name: git state: present"
    change module to yum & execute
        ansible all -a "name: git state: present"
