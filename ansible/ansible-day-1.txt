A. Introduction
=================
1. What is configuration Management?

	a. Before we discuss about ansible first will discuss about configuration management tool.

	b. In earlier when we have to install some software in any machine, 
		i. normally login to server manually
		ii. Install the required software (tomcat)
	    iii. Do the changes in configuration of software files to make our application run smoothly.
		
	c. Now assume when you have situations to handle large number of servers for installing same software,
	d. Chances for human errors
	e. Lot of human efforts required
	f. To overcome this issue configuration management tool came into picture
       CM tool taken repsonsbility for making the target systems & softwares in desired and consitent state.

2. In market we have different types of CM tool's
	- ansible
	- chef
	- puppet
	- salt
3. Ansible not only acts as configuration management tool but it also support orchestration tool.

4. Orchestration tool nothing provising/creating resoures like ec2 on public clouds like ec2,alb..etc. similar to terraform.

5. But best for choosing ansible for CM & terraform as orchestration tool since some of advanced feature in terraform.

6. Out of these CM tools ansible is the widely used CM tool.

=======================
B.Ansible architecture
========================
a. Create & Explain diagram ansible_day_1.png

				      ------------> Ansible node-0  {Linux}
b. Ansible controller ------------> Ansible node-1  {ubuntu}
				      ------------> Ansible node-2  { windows}

c. Ansible controller/Ansible Management Node --> Where is configuration changes needs to be installed.

d. Nodes --> Are the target machine that we going to do configuration changes implement.

e. The connectivity established from Ansible controller to target machines using ssh key based authentication.
   On target servers we don't required to install any agent software to establish connectivity to controller.

f. hosts --> contains the list of target machines IP/hostnames.

g. playbook --> The script files that we have written to automate the tasks.
             The playbooks will be written in yml format. YAML nothing but Yaint markup language.
			 It's a declarative language. Easy to understandable & writable.

C. Why ansible is popular than chef?
===================================
a. Ansible works on push based mechanisam but chef works on pull based mechanisam.
b. Ansible is a agentless configuration management tool but chef is a agent based configuration management tool.
c. Ansible is supported by Redhat systems, so this is addon all unix flavours.


=================
D. Ansible setup
=================
Create one ansible controller & 3 target machines (RHEL, Amazon Linux, Ubuntu)

1. Prepare ansible controller server/EC2
    a. Create EC2 instance
	b. Create ansible user
	c. Add ansible user to sudoers file
	d. Generate ssh keys for ansible user
	e. Enable password based authentication
	f. Check python presence
	f. Install ansible
	
2. Prepare target node
	a. Create EC2 instance
	b. create ansible user
	c. Add ansible user to sudoers file
	d. Enable password based authentication
	e. Check python presence
	
3. Copy the key of ansible user from controller to target machine ansible user
	ssh-copy-id ansible@<target-ec2-ip>
	
4. Adding target machine details into inventory file

5. Test the connectivity from controller to target machines
   ansible -m ping all
   
   Provide some wrong IP address & check connectivity
